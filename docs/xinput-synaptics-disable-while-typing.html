<p>I've seen this happen on various machines and various Linux distros and I keep forgetting the exact way to control the behavior, so a blog post is due.</p>
<p>Essentially on an Xorg setup the default behavior for touchpads is to stop pointer activity as soon as a keyboard button is pressed or held.</p>
<p>If for example you wanted to relax a bit and play an Openarena match, you will quickly discover that when you use WASD to move in-game, the touchpad gets "locked" and you cannot look around ... until you stop moving.</p>

<p>Input devices on an Xorg machine are handled by the <code>xinput</code> utility. You can configure these devices to a usually very high detail, but you need to know how.</p>
<p>To start with, you've got to find your device. Run</p>
<pre><code>xinput list
</code></pre>
<p>(or just <code>xinput</code>)</p>
<p>and you will get back a detailed listing of input devices. Each will have its ID listed like so</p>
<pre><code>...
⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]
...
</code></pre>
<p>(in this example it's id=12). Find your device in the list and remember that ID.</p>
<p>To see what properties can be configured for this device, run</p>
<pre><code>xinput list-props 12
</code></pre>
<p>among which you can find, for example, something like</p>
<pre><code>libinput Disable While Typing Enabled (355):    1
</code></pre>
<p>where the 355 represents the ID of that one specific setting, and the 1 represents what it is set to at the moment (1 meaning true since this setting is boolean).</p>
<p>To disable it, I run</p>
<pre><code>xinput set-prop 12 355 0
</code></pre>
<p>and to confirm the settings has been applied I can do</p>
<pre><code>xinput list-props 12
</code></pre>
<p>again.</p>
<p>That's it. Feel free to explore various settings and look them up and BE CAREFUL not to change things you don't understand.</p>
