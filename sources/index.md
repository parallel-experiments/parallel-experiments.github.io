# Welcome to this notebook!

Here I write notes about obscure or forgettable issues I commonly have to deal with.

## Table of Contents

There is none :)

I'm experimenting with minimalistic web publishing and I'm trying to lean into hyperlinking as a fundamental feature of the web.

At the moment I'm interested in how a website can be represented without a "God view" with everything included but as pages pointing to one another that you can explore via a [Next] button at the bottom of each page (no need for [Previous], your browser already does that!). There are some interesting implications of this approach.

Other info and resources can be found on my [website/digital garden](https://lukal.neocities.org).
